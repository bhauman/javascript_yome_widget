# Functional JavaScript with React Yome Widget

I wrote this widget to demonstrate how to write straightforward
functional code with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

The the blogpost. ;; not published link needed 

If you would like to experiment with this code you will need to
install [Babel](http://babeljs.io/).

```
npm install -g babel
```

To auto-compile this code each time you save the `yome.js` file you
will need to run babel like so:

```
babel src/ -w --out-dir build/
``` 

The top of the `yome.js` file has a little auto-loading script that
will continuously reload the code. This allows you to change the code
and experiment with code and see your changes **without reloading the
browser**.

Have fun!!
